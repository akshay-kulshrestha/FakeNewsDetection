# Fake News Detection using LSTM

This project implements a deep learning model based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to detect fake news from textual data.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal is to classify news articles as **real** or **fake** using natural language processing and an LSTM neural network model. This project is part of a study to understand how deep learning can help combat misinformation.

## 🧠 Model

- **Type**: LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network)
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Training**: The model is trained on a labeled dataset of real and fake news.
- **Inputs**: Preprocessed news headlines or articles.
- **Outputs**: Binary label (`Real` or `Fake`)
